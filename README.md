# <a src="https://viniciustocchio.github.io/3-column-preview-card/">Frontend Mentor - 3 column preview card</a>

Another challange from Frontend Mentor, and the proposal is to compose a card with 3 column.

In this exercise, I could practice a little bit more HTML, CSS, flexbox and it was good training to creating responsive layouts (desktop and mobile).
